# The TradeBook ( Under Development )

This is an interesting project which came to my mind, when I found it difficult to document my own trades. Documenting your trades is of at most importance and that is what seperates a novice trader from a professionl.

One who documents his/her trades tends to not to repeat the same mistake.

This platform ( upon completion ) will have the facility to document trades with entry, exit, dates, chart Images, notes, etc all in a seamless manner in just few clicks.
